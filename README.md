# 3DRayTracing

This is a computing project as part of the Year 2 Advanced Practical Physics course in Imperial College Physics. The goal of this project is to model and examine various optical systems in real life and ultimately, to deliver a 3D optical ray tracer. The performance of this toolkit was tested (see testing.py), with the results fully analysed in the project report (see pdf).
